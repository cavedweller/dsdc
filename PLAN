- 2 Round registration protocol ?
- Mget 
- Slave groups
- Mget Custom
- Master gossip
- Code refactor: separate clients from slaves in both protocol and also
  class hierarchy
X clients get data directly from slaves
- move data on new node addition
   X this will require each slave to listen on a TCP port for 
     incoming connections.
- statistics!  who is up; hit ratios, etc..
- some data can be stored more than once, for redundancy.  store on
  predecessors.  kind of assumes effective data movement though.


Nits
-----
- don't memcpy data on lookups.
